my foundation was but while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city i was entering a new one a war that was based on apartheid and discrimination made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what i learned the word was respect just because you wore a different gang color than mines doesn t mean i can t respect you as a black man forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets if i respect you we unify and stop the enemy from killing us but i don t know i m no mortal man maybe i m just another nigga shit and that s all i wrote i was gonna call another nigga but it ain t really a poem i just felt like it s something you probably could relate to other than that now that i finally got a chance to holla at you i always wanted to ask you about a certain situa about a metaphor actually you spoke on the ground what you mean bout that what the ground represent the ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil that s how i see it my word is bond i see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people cause the rich people gonna be so fat they gonna be so

ghetto is quite a routine and last night was just another distraction or a reaction of what we consider madness i know exactly what happened you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help held him like a newborn baby and made him feel like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up but the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will as blood spilled on your hands my plans rather vindictive everybody s a victim in my eyes when i ride it s a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black a demon glued to my back whispering get em i got em and i ain t give a f ck that same mentality that told my brother not to duck in actuality it s a trip how we trip off of colors i wonder if i ll ever discover a passion like you and recover the life that i knew as a young n in pajamas and dun ta duns when thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb niggas like me never prosper prognosis of a problem child i m proud and well devoted this piru shit been in me forever so forever i mma push it wherever whenever and i love you cause you love my brother like you did just promise me you ll tell this story when you make it big and if i die before your album drop i hope when the lights shut off and its my turn to settle down my main concern promise that you will sing about me promise that you will sing about me you wrote a song about my sister on your tape and called it section the message resemble brenda s got a baby whats crazy was i was hearin about it but doubted your ignorance how could you ever just put her on blast and shit judging her past and shit well it s completely my future a nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit and i mma need that dollars even if i gotta f ck suck and swallow in the parking lot gonzales park i m followed by a married man a father of three my titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with e s he got a cousin named david and i seen him last week this is the life of another girl damaged by the system these foster homes i run away and never do miss em see my hormones just run away and if i can get em back to where they used to be then i ll probably be in the denim of a family gene that show women how to be woman or better yet a leader you need her to learn something then you probably need to beat her that s how i was taught three niggas in one room first time i was tossed and i m exhausted but f ck that sorry for your loss shit my sister died in vain but what point are you trying to gain if you can t fit the pumps i walk in i ll wait your rebuttal a little too late and if you have a album date just make sure i m not in the song cause i don t need the attention bring enough of that on my own and matter fact did i mention that i physically feel great a doctor s approval is a waste of time i know i m straight i ll probably live longer than you and never fade away i ll never fade away i ll never fade away i know my fate and i m on the grind for this cake i mma get or die trying i m eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying you lying to these motherfuckers talking about you can help with my story you can help me if you sell this pussy for me nigga don t ignore me nigga where the f ck is u going nigga this bullshit when the lights shut off and its my turn to settle down my main concern promise that you will sing about me promise that you will sing about me sometimes i look in a mirror and ask myself am i really scared of passing away if it s today i hope i hear a cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon with the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of jesus i wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline rake in the cent of a reaper ensuring that my allegiance with the other side may come soon and if i m doomed may the wound help my mother be blessed for many moons i suffer a lot and every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch i tie my stomach in knots and i m sure not why i m infatuated with death my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats that can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerful and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch maybe cause i m dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death really stuck in the scheme of wondering when i mma rest and you re right your brother was a brother to me and your sister s situation was the one that put me in a direction to speak of something that s realer than the tv screen by any means wasn t trying to offend or come between her personal life i was like it need to be told cursing the life of generations after her so exactly would have happened if i hadn t continued rappin or steady being distracted by money drugs and four fives i count lives all on these songs look at the weak and cry pray one day you ll be strong fighting for your rights even when you re wrong and hope that at least one of you sing about me when i m gone now am i worth it did i put enough work in when the lights shut off and its my turn to settle down my main concern promise that you will sing about me promise that you will sing about me promise that you will sing about me promise that you will sing about me
