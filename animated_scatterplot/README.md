# Animated Scatterplot

### This project aims to replicate [this project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo&ab_channel=BBC) by Hans Roslings work for the BBC.

Libraries used include:

* pandas
* matplotlib
* imageio

Data was first read in, then cleaned, and melted for better sorting and organization. After transformation, the files were then grouped by continent and plotted by year. These individual yearly graphs were then compiled into one gif.

* With this simple graph, we can see a few trends:
1. In general the world has improved in terms of life expectancy.
2. In general the world seems to have become more developed.
- Lower fertility rates generally correlate to higher levels of development.
3. Population is increasing globally
- More recently, this rate has increased.
4. Continents can differ wildly.
- Europe started out quite developed with high life expectancy.
- Asia has rapidly caught up in all categories.
- Africa continues to lag behind the rest of the world
